Design a coffee machine which dispenses different beverages, based on a set of ingredients, in different proportions and combinations.
The design should easily allow for other recipes and ingredients to be added.

The basic ingredients and their prices:

   - coffee shot (75p)
   - sugar (15p)
   - milk (30p)
   - cream (30p)
   - chocolate (35p)


Upon ordering a beverage, the coffee machine should display its price. The cost of the drink is the total cost of its ingredients.

The machine should dispense the following recipes:

   - espresso 
       - 1 x coffee + 1 x sugar

   - americano
       - 2 x coffee 

   - latte
      - 2 x coffee + 1 x sugar + 2 x milk

   - hot chocolate
      - 2 x chocolate + 2 x milk + 1 x sugar

   - mocha
      - 1 x coffee + 2 x milk + 1 x sugar
